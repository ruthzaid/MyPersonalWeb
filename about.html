            <p>
                Hi, my name is Ruth. <br> 

                I'm a student that enjoys photographing things that stand out to me <br>
                while on the go.<br><br>
                
                I am a second year university student residing in Addis Ababa Ethiopia. 
                I am currently majoring in Software Engineering at the Addis Ababa Institute of Technology. 
                I would like to mostly focus on web design and development in the future
                to help companies and organizations, here in Ethiopia, manage better websites in terms of
                aesthetics, efficiency and accessibility. I would also like to be a part of making personal computers
                and internet connection widely available to most, if not all, of the population in Ethiopia 
                so as to make life easier and introduce online schooling, online shopping and more.<br><br>

                I have lived in a couple different countries and travelled my fair share over the past few years.
                This website is mostly for me to post photos I have taken over the years. In the 
                <a href="photography.html">photography section</a> of this website, I have posted photos 
                I've taken in different places such as New Jersey, New York, Washington D.C, Niagra Falls and Montreal. <br><br>

                If you would like to connect with me, head over to my <a href="contact.html">contact page</a>.
                I look forward to hearing from you! <br><br>
